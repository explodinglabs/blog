Engineers achieve big things by solving little problems. If we can solve all
the little problems, we can combine the solutions to solve bigger problems.

Why do we break down problems? This is due to the limitations of the human mind
. We can only deal with a small number of concepts at a time, so we break down
problems, and break them down again until we can mentally digest them.

A well decomposed problem produces an elegant solution.

We solve each problem, zooming in to focus on a single arrow, ignoring
everything else.

In programming we solve small problems by writing functions. A function is an
expression that gets you from `a` to `b` _and nothing more_. Given an `a` and
no more than an `a`, it provides a `b` and does no more than that.

Finally, we combine the solutions.

So programming (and problem solving) is about composition: decomposing
problems, solving them and then composing the solutions.
