title: Server-Sent Events not working with Webpack's Dev Server

Using Webpack Dev Server, Server-Sent-Events aren't picked up by the Javascript
EventSource. The EventSource `onopen` fires, but not any listeners.

There are two options to fix this:

1. Disable compression in the webpack devserver config.
2. Send `Content-Type: no-transform` in the response header.
