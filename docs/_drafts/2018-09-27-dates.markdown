## DAG

- start_date: The timestamp from which the scheduler will attempt to
    backfill. This is no longer required.
- end_date: A date beyond which your DAG won't run. Default is None, meaning
    open ended scheduling (no end date).

Unless backfilling, in most cases there is no need to set these dates for a
DAG, and the values don't really serve any interesting value.
