An important part of the _PEP-8 Style Guide for Python Code_
is the [Imports
section](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports).

This part on **grouping imports** is particularly important:

> Imports should be grouped in the following order:
>
> - Standard library imports.
> - Related third party imports.
> - Local application/library specific imports.
>
> <cite>PEP-8: The Style Guide for Python Code</cite>

## The first group, "Standard library imports"

These are from the Python's built-in standard library.

```python
from typing import Any
import os
```

## The second group, "Related third party imports"

"Third party"
confuses a lot of people. To me it could be a library maintained by yourself or
the same organisation, but is _inst1alled as
separate package_.

```python
from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults
from cx_Oracle import NUMBER
```

## The third group, "Local application/library specific imports"

I take this to mean "imports from the same repository".

```python
from .stored_procedure_operator import StoredProcedureOperator
```

## Putting it together

```python
from typing import Any
import os

from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults
from cx_Oracle import NUMBER

from .stored_procedure_operator import StoredProcedureOperator
```

Be sure to separate the groups. 

> You should put a blank line between each group of imports.

Within each group, sort the lines alphabetically (this is
not part of the style guide, just my recommendation).
