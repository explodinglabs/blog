A key part of the _PEP-8 Style Guide for Python Code_
is the [Imports](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports) section.
</div>
This part on **grouping imports** is particularly important.

> Imports should be grouped in the following order:
>
> - Standard library imports.
> - Related third party imports.
> - Local application/library specific imports.
>
> <cite>PEP-8: The Style Guide for Python Code</cite>

## "Standard library imports"

This refers to imports from Python's built-in [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html).

```python
from typing import Any
import os
```

## "Related third party imports"

"Third party"
confuses a lot of people. These imports could be maintained by yourself or
your organisation, but are _installed as a
separate package_.

```python
from airflow.utils.helpers import chain
import requests
```

## "Local application/library specific imports"

I take this to mean "imports from the same repository".

```python
from . import settings
from .my_package import my_function
```

## Separate groups with a blank line

Be sure to separate the groups with a blank line. 

> You should put a blank line between each group of imports.
>
> <cite>PEP-8: The Style Guide for Python Code</cite>

## Import order

Within each group, sort imports alphabetically. (This is not part of the
style guide, just my recommendation.)

```python
from z_package import (
    a_module,
    b_module,
    c_module,
)
import a_package
```

## Putting it all together

```python
"""Module-level docstring"""
from typing import Any
import os

from airflow.utils.helpers import chain
import requests

from . import settings
from .my_package import my_function


# Code starts here after two blank lines. 
```
