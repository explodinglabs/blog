## When to use Decorators

- Add functionality before or after a function is executed.
- Data sanitization or addition.
- Function or class registration.
- Logging.

## When to use Context Managers

- Resource cleanliness (cleaning up after your code block).
- Handling exceptions, avoiding repetition.

## When to use Generators

- Accessing data in pieces.
- Computing data in pieces.

## When to use Metaclasses

- Modify class structure from the way it was declared, (e.g. Django model).
- Class verification (ensure class conforms to a particular interface).
- Non-inheriting attributes. e.g. make an abstract class not inherit attributes.
- Class registration.
